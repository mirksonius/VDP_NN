# VDP_NN
An academic example of a Neural Network trained to discover the dynamics of a nonlinear system.
A FFNN is used to discover the propeties of the phase space of na Van der Pol ocillator.
The network is trained on a generated trajecory and has to predict the 'force field' at every given point in the phase space.
